# lucene-ir-engine
An extremely simple IR Engine based on Apache Tika and Apache Lucene for indexing and searching heterogeneous documents.

## Getting Started

To build the project, you can type the following command:

> mvn clean install

To run the ctakes-clinical-pipeline, you can launch the following scripts (in `/src/main/bin`):

* ./indexer.sh
* ./searcher.sh

In `/src/main/bin`, you can find also the same utilities for Windows (i.e., `indexer.bat` and `searcher.bat`).
